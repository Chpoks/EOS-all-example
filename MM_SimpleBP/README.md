## Matchmaking Blueprints Example for Unreal Engine 5.0

This is the Matchmaking blueprints example project for Unreal Engine 5.0. It demonstrates how to use the Matchmaking plugin with EOS Online Subsystem entirely from blueprints.

It doesn't require Online Subsystem Blueprints.

### Configure EOS

You will need to configure the EOS plugin with your own organisation, sandbox, product and client IDs, as outlined in [the documentation](https://redpointgames.gitlab.io/eos-online-subsystem/docs/core_getting_started).

Once you've replaced the existing values with your own, you should be able to run the example project in the editor.
